  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Venezuelan empanadas are half-moon shaped sweet/savory dough pastries that are traditionally fried, and prepared
    with precooked cornmeal, which is what makes them so crispy and different from the rest of the empanadas in the
    continent. They can be filled with just about anything! Many places in Venezuela make them with the most incredible
    fillings. The most common are shredded meat, ground meat, chicken, dogfish, cheese, caraotas (black beans), and
    pabellón.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Dough</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons sugar.</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for greasing and frying.</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter.</li>

        <li>3 1/2 cups precooked cornmeal.</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Sauce</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups cilantro.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil.</li>
        <li>1 medium avocado, halved, seeded and peeled.</li>
        <li>1/4 green bell pepper, chopped.</li>
        <li>1 scallion, chopped.</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons white vinegar.</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed.</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Make the filling: Place the beef, bay leaves, 1 tablespoon salt and water to cover in a saucepan and bring to a
      boil over medium heat. Reduce to a simmer, cover and cook until the meat is almost falling apart, about 1 hour 30
      minutes. Transfer the meat to a bowl and shred with a fork; cool. Reserve the broth.</li>
    <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic and shallot;
      cook until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in the scallion, paprika, sazon completa, oregano,
      cumin and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add the beef and 1 cup of the reserved broth and cook over medium heat until thick,
      about 10 minutes. Season with salt.</li>
    <li>Make the dough: Mix 3 1/2 cups hot water, the sugar, vegetable oil, butter and salt in a medium bowl until the
      butter melts. Stir in the cornmeal and flour until a soft dough forms, then knead on a clean surface until the
      dough comes together. Shape into 12 balls, using about 1/2 cup dough for each.</li>
    <li>One at a time, sprinkle each dough ball with water, place between two pieces of lightly oiled heavy-duty plastic
      wrap (a cut resealable bag works well) and roll into a 7-inch circle. Remove the top sheet of plastic and place 2
      to 3 tablespoons filling in the center of the dough. Use the bottom piece of</li>
    <li>plastic to fold the dough in half over the filling and press to seal. Trim into a half-moon shape with a knife
      or press down with the round edge of a bowl. Remove the plastic and place the empanada on a parchment-lined baking
      sheet.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Heat 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet until a deep-fry thermometer
      registers 365 degrees F. Fry the empanadas in batches until golden, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a
      paper-towel-lined baking sheet; keep warm in the oven.</li>
    <li>Make the sauce: Combine the cilantro, olive oil, avocado, bell pepper, scallion, vinegar and garlic in a
      blender. Add 1 teaspoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper and puree until smooth. Thin out the sauce with up to 1/4 cup
      water and serve with the empanadas.</li>
  </ol>
