    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Arepas are a staple in Colombian and Venezuelan cuisine, consisting of
      flat, round patties made from ground maize dough, often served with a
      variety of fillings and toppings. They are enjoyed as a breakfast, lunch,
      dinner, or snack, and can be adapted to different tastes and preferences.
